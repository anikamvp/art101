					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						<ul> <li> My biggest issue was with my image, it wasn't showing up for a while but after talking with wesbot I was able to get it to work. </li></ul>
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> It went well. Wesbot always is helpful but I was able to figure out a lot it by myself which made me proud. This lab has made images and file issues much easier to fix now. </p>
