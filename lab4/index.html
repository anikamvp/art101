			<h1>Lab 4 - pseudocode</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						<ul> <li> I was sick when we first started the lab so it was hard for me to work on it but doing it was easy, no problems.</li></ul>
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I created new files and edited them accordingly. I  followed the instructions, edited the html a bit and uploaded it to the server. I also messed around with the css a bit to make it look more appealing.</p>
