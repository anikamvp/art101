			<h1>Lab Two - Hello World!</h1>
			<div class="intro">
				<p> My name is Anika, and I'm a fourth-year art major and transfer student. Before this, I spent two years at Sierra College, my hometown community college, where I earned an associate's degree in Illustration. My favorite class there was watercolor painting. I have one cat named Panther here with me, and back in my hometown, I also have three pets: Thor and Loki, who are cat brothers, and Chewbacca, a Lhasa Apso. My classmate Liam is also a transfer student, majoring in film and digital media. He came from Palomar Community College in San Marcos, where he enjoyed media classes and screenprinting. One of his highlights was making custom playing cards themed around himself and his friends on PVC cards. At home, Liam has three cats: a black cat named Prince, a Bengal named Merlin, and a tabby named Momo.</p>
