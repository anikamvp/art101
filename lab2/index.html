			<h1>Lab Two - Hello World!</h1>
			<div class="intro">
					<p>My name is Liam, I am a transfer with a major in film and digital media, I came from a community college called Palomar in San Marcos. My highlights from there were the media classes and screenprinting. In screenprinting, a highlight was I made custom playing cards themed around me and my friends on PVC cards. At home, I have 3 cats: a black cat named Prince, a bangle named Merlin, and a tabby named Momo</p>

					<p>My name is Anika. I'm a fourth-year art major and a transfer student. Before this, I spent two years at Sierra College, my hometown community college, where I earned an associate's degree in Illustration. My favorite class there was watercolor painting. I have one cat named Panther here with me. Back in my hometown, I also have three pets: Thor and Loki, who are cat brothers, and Chewbacca, a Lhasa Apso.</P>
