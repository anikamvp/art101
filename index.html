					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I grew up in Nevada County Califorina, we were Nevada before the state Nevada, look it up. I love my hometown but I love Santa Cruz as well. The beaches are my favorite place to go. I love also the bookshop, the begalry, and the boardwalk. My last name is Paredes but I want to change it to Anika Vodicka though, that's my mom's last name. I am a fourth year here at ucsc. I am an art major and work at a children musuem here in Santa Cruz! I live with my boyfriend and my cat downtown. My cat's name is Panther. He's my best kitty friend</p>
